Courage and Risk Taking
Leader need courage to make the touch decisions they faced with everyday. Joshua certainly faced a crisis in his leadership
role. Not only did he have to contend with the military power rooted in the promised land, but he also had to face them with
and untrained band of nomadic shepherds.

God realized Joshua's need for courage and give hime guidance that would strenghten his faith. First God reminded Joshua of 
his faithfulneed to keep all of his promises(see vv.3-6). God had pledged to give the land to his people. and he would fullfill
the pledge. Joshua's success didn't rest on the military strategy or well-trained army, but on the faithfulness of God. Second, 
God commaned Joshua to meditate on the worlds that Moses had recorded in the five books of Pentateuch(see vv.7-8). The "Book
of Law" would give Joshua wisdom and encouragement he would need to courageously lead the nation.

Third, God promised to be personaly present with Joshua(see v.9). No matter how intimidating the enemy or how rebellious the 
people, Joshua would not have to face them alone. God would always be at his side.

The same source of courage that enpowered Joshua are available today for any leader who will accept them. When faced with a
risky business decision, the godly leader would look to God in prayer and to God's revealed Word for the perspective and courage
needed to make the right choice. What situation are you now facing that requires courageous leadership and risk taking? Let God's
words to Joshua supply you with the crourage you need.
